# SwiftUI ToDo App with Firebase Authentication and Firestore

NOTE THAT THE PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS

This repository contains an iOS application developed using SwiftUI. The primary objective of this application is to provide a feature-rich to-do list app with user authentication powered by Firebase.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern, declarative UI framework for building native iOS apps. It allows for a clean and efficient way to create user interfaces.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is a powerful and scalable mobile and web application development platform by Google. In this application, we leverage Firebase for user authentication and Firestore for database storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely authenticate using Firebase Authentication.

- **ToDo List**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks in their to-do list.

- **Real-time Updates**: Changes made to tasks are instantly synchronized with Firestore, providing a seamless real-time experience.

## Getting Started

To run this app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Firebase Configuration**: You'll need to set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore). Add your Firebase configuration files to the project as instructed by Firebase documentation.

3. **Build and Run**: Open the Xcode project, build the app, and run it on a simulator or a physical device.
